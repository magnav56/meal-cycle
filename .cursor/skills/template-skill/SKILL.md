# Template Skill

<!-- Replace everything below with your skill's specific instructions. -->

## Overview

Briefly describe what this skill does and why it exists. Keep it to 2-3 sentences.

## When to Use

- List the specific scenarios that should trigger this skill
- Be explicit about keywords or user intents that are relevant
- Example: "When the user asks to generate a migration file"

## Instructions

Step-by-step guidance for the agent. Be concise — the agent is smart; only include what it wouldn't already know.

1. **Step one** — describe the first action
2. **Step two** — describe the next action
3. **Step three** — validate or finalize

## Key Conventions

List project-specific patterns, naming rules, or constraints the agent must follow.

- Convention 1 (e.g., "All API routes live in `server/routes/`")
- Convention 2 (e.g., "Use camelCase for variable names")
- Convention 3

## Output Template

If this skill produces structured output, provide a template:
